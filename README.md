# Life Expectancy Analysis with R

This repository contains an R project that explores the relationship between various factors and life expectancy using multiple linear regression analysis. The project aims to build a predictive model for life expectancy and gain insights into the key determinants of life expectancy.

## About

Linear regression is used for various purposes, including: 

- Prediction: Given a set of predictor values, you can use the linear regression model to predict the value of the dependent variable.
- Understanding Relationships: Linear regression helps in understanding how changes in one or more independent variables are associated with changes in the dependent variable.
- Hypothesis Testing: You can use linear regression to test hypotheses about the relationships between variables and assess their statistical significance.
- Model Evaluation: It provides a simple and interpretable model that can be evaluated using various metrics to assess its performance.
- Feature Selection: Linear regression can be used to identify the most important predictors in a dataset.

This project focuses on implementing Multiple Linear Regression using R code on World Life Expectancy data.
